# PathShade

PathShade is a small wrapper around Reshade for Star Citizen, that is designed to make the
installation and management of both the Reshade System and its presets as painless as possible.
Originally PathShade was designed and built for the UEE Pathfinders, a mil-sim based Star Citizen
organization, to make the installation of Reshade as easy as possible.
